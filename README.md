# DBH-Net
Fusing Transformer and U-Net for Stomach Cancer Image Segmentation Network

train.py file is used to train the network, where you need to pass in data images, just run python train.py directly

test.py file is used to test the results, and we give the evaluation code for each metric, run python.test.py directly

You can change the parameter configuration in arg

We use SwinTransformer network, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we need to load the pre-trained model, which is also given in our file
